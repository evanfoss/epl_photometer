** Project Description
This project is a photometer, unlike a conventional light meter it is designed to take readings of a stroboscopic light source. It is compact and shielded enough to put in a chamber and operate continuously. It is not meant for perfect for any application because of the limitations in it's response to specific wavelengths and in calibration. It is made with the best matched photodiodes available in our price range. It is also limited in that do to our inability to develop a good reference for single wavelength calibration the device is only good for qualitative (relative) measurements not quantitative measurements. We are working to rectify this last limitation but there is no telling how long it will take to find an adequate calibration method.

The following are the directories in this project and their contence.

4alberta		The files for the LT1793-sheilded version of the board.
README.text		This file.
datasheets		The data sheets for the various parts used/(considered for use) in the project.
lt1793-sheilded		The 1st production version of the device using an LT1793 for the transimpedance amplifier and a shield using 0.1" spaced headers.
lt1793-unsheilded	The pre-production version of the device using an LT1793 for the transimpedance amplifier minus the shield.
ltc6240			The pre-production version of the device using an LTC6240 for the transimpedance amplifier for higher frequency responce. This design is incomplete.
math			The scripts and calculations used for the design of the device.
